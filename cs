		   <h3>About</h3>
		
		Carnegie Mellon’s School of Computer Science (SCS) is one of the world’s premier institutions for computer science research and education. From the beginnings of “thinking computers” through today’s intelligent tutors, our award-winning faculty, researchers and students are internationally known for consistently developing new methods and technologies that have an enduring impact on academic, scientific and commercial endeavors. Innovations such as speech recognition software, Internet search engines and the precursor of the Mac OS-X operating system can trace their roots to the interdisciplinary and collaborative environment of SCS and the technologically advanced Carnegie Mellon campus.
